# MCMV Core

This is a C++ implementation of MCMV, which should be much faster thanks to the compiled nature of C++, as well as this implementation using multithreading whenever possible.

The project is currently in early development, if you would like a working version, please check out the Python version [here](https://github.com/hanmindev/mcmv)
